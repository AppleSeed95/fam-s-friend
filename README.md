Update your .env file with the following. You can see your .env by typing sudo nano .env or just by clicking on the file if you are in VS Code.

```plain
OPEN_AI_ORG=enter-you-key-here
OPEN_AI_KEY=enter-you-key-here
ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY=enter-you-key-here
```

### Start your backend server

```

Alternatively, you can ensure your server resets every time you make a change by typing:

```shell
uvicorn main:app -- reload
```

You can check your server is working by going to:

```
